I'm fully aware that all modern models - including the ones I've used to make this comic - function by effectively stealing millions of images from much more talented people than I.
However, it did provide a vehicle to tell a story that I dreamed up when I was 16 trying to understand the two-photon double-slit experiment - wondering what wavefunction collapse would be like as a super-power... 
Anyway, this is a labour of love. Please enjoy.
